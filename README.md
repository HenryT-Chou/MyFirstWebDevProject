Started on Jun 2020 as a platform to learn CSS/HTML/JS for web development / web applications

Followed Colt Steele HTML/CSS/JS crash course video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Uauq-Gd0c&list=PLblA84xge2_y8F1K0wzPia9V_ULVcfg4k

Mostly played around and familiarized myself with some basic elements
